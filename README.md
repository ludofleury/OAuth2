# Research & Development project about OAuth2

_This is a pure PHP translation from the RFC_ (__Version draft 25__)

All interfaces are documented (@version, @api, @links, @return).
Project structure is PSR-0 and is normalized in this way :

* src
    * [grant flow type]
        * Authorization
          * Request
          * Response
          * Error
        * AccessToken
          * Request
          * Response
          * Error
